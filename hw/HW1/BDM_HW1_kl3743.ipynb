    "This homework is for practicing Python’s *generators* and the design of *streaming* algorithms in general. We’re going to use the **taxi_events.csv** and **taxi_trips.csv** data sets. Both of them are available on NYU Classes under *Data Sets* section. You are required to turn in this notebook with all the parts filled in place of <###>. Your notebook must be named BDM\\_HW1\\_NetID.ipynb."

    "Your task is to **compute the maximum number of active taxi cabs** that were hired at any point in time. This the same as computing the maximum number of taxi cabs that have passengers. The input data set is **taxi_events.csv**, which logged all pick-up and drop-off events for all taxi trips. The description of the fields in this file is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Column name|Description|\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "|time |The timestamp of the event. All events are sorted increasingly by their timestamps. |\n",
    "|vehicle_id |The unique ID of the taxi vehicle involved in this event. |\n",
    "|event |A string of either *\"pickup\"* or *\"dropoff\"* for describing the drop-off or pick-up event, respectively. |\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's assume that on *Feb-01-2015*, there was a taxi that picked up a passenger at midnight and dropped her off at 14 minutes past midnight. If the taxi cab has the Vehicle ID of *V102*, then you should see two events being logged in this data set as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "...\n",
    "2015-02-01 00:00:00+00,V102,pickup\n",

    "...\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the above data set in a streaming fashion (reading in row by row), and must design a streaming algorithm that uses the least possible additional memory to compute the maximum number of hired taxi cabs at any point in time. Again, this is equivalent to having a virtual dispatcher, who repeatedly ask every second *\"how many taxis are being hired (having passengers) at the moment?\"*, and then log the maximum number during the entire period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please modify the code snippet below to complete this task. Your code should only output a single number, which is the maximum number of hired taxi cabs. Of course, you can add additional initialization codes outside of the for loop as needed. Additional, please provide a brief rationale and/or justification for your design after the code."
